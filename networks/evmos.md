[Evmos](https://evmos.org/) is a decentralized proof of stake blockchain in the Cosmos ecosystem. It is Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based, meaning it is fully compatible with the Ethereum network. Evmos’ goal is to bring the world of Ethereum-based applications and assets to the interoperable networks of the Cosmos ecosystem, while aligning developer and user incentives and aiming to innovate in the space of EVM and interchain composability.

Built using the Cosmos SDK with Tendermint Core consensus, Evmos offers the fast finality and high-throughput of Cosmos-based blockchains. By using Ethereum’s EVM, developers can deploy their Ethereum-based applications in the Tendermint consensus environment with lower transaction fees, faster transaction speeds, and security provided by proof of stake consensus.

Evmos has also enabled Cosmos’ Inter-blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC). Therefore EVM applications deployed on Evmos can also be accessed by participants in networks across the broader Cosmos ecosystem. Users from all IBC-enabled independent blockchains will be able to access the utility seen on Ethereum, including decentralized exchanges, marketplaces, lending protocols, NFT applications, gaming, and more, as developers deploy their mature application logic from Ethereum directly on Evmos.\
