Staking MED on Cosmostation is pretty easy when you follow these few steps:

### 1. **Select your Medibloc wallet in the Cosmostation mobile app**

Open the Cosmostation mobile app on your device and make sure to switch to your **Medibloc wallet** from the available network list.\
You'll get to see an overview of the your current MED balance that is in your Medibloc wallet.

### 2. **Choose AUDIT.one as your validator**

When you've found your Medibloc wallet in the app, click on the **Delegate** button to see the list of all active validators. Select the middle button "**Top**" to get the full list of active validators.\


To find us, scroll down the list until you find our logo.\


When you click on a validator, you will find some extra info. It shows the total assets bonded aka [voting power](../../glossary/voting\_power.md) of the validator, the estimated [APY](../../glossary/apy.md) and the [validator commission fee](../../glossary/validator\_fee.md).

Once you understand these terms, tap **Delegate** to continue.\


### 3. **Choose the amount you wish to delegate**

Fill in the amount you wish to stake and hit **Next**

{% hint style="info" %}
TIP: It might be a good idea to keep a small amount of tokens in your balance to use for future transactions like claiming rewards for example.
{% endhint %}

You can add a memo to your delegation, but this is not obligatory. Continue by clicking **Next**\


You will be asked to choose the [transaction fee](../../glossary/transaction\_fees.md) (tiny, low or average). The higher the fee you are willing to pay, the faster the transaction will be completed.

{% hint style="info" %}
TIP: Click on ‘**Check Estimate Gas Amount**’ to minimize your fee.
{% endhint %}

You will now see the overview of your transaction. If everything is correct, hit **Confirm**

Before you finish the transaction, it's very important to understand the concept of an **unbonding period**. If you don't know what an unbonding period is, we suggest you to first read the guide on [what is an unbonding period?](../../glossary/unbonding\_period.md)\


If you understand the concept of an unbonding period, hit **Continue**.\


Wait for your transaction to be excecuted until the overview screen is shown.\
Click **Done** to go back to your wallet.

#### **Congratulations!**

You have now succesfully staked your MED tokens!

### 4. **Claim rewards and restake regularly to benefit from** [**compounding effects**](../../glossary/compounding\_interest.md)

Make sure to come back to your wallet overview to see the status of your delegation and to claim your rewards:\


You can claim your pending rewards by clicking on the **Delegate** button in your Medibloc wallet.\


Select the validator you have delegated your funds to under the "**My**" tab.\


Now **Claim your rewards** and they will be added to your available MED balance which you can find in your wallet overview.\
