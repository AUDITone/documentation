[**Persistence**](https://wallet.persistence.one/) is a Tendermint-based specialised layer-1 focused on creating use-cases around liquid staked assets. Itâ€™s aiming to become the liquid staking hub for the PoS (Proof-of-Stake) economy, facilitating the issuance and deployment of liquid-staked stkASSETs in the DeFi ecosystem to allow users to earn staking rewards while simultaneously participating in DeFi primitives.\
