[**Cosmos**](https://cosmos.network/) is an ever-expanding ecosystem of interconnected apps and services, built for a decentralized future. In other words, Cosmos is an **ecosystem of blockchains** that can scale and interoperate with each other. Before Cosmos, blockchains were siloed and unable to communicate with each other. They were hard to build and could only handle a small amount of transactions per second. Cosmos solves these problems with a new technical vision.\
