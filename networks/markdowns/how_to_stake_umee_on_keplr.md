Staking UMEE on Keplr is pretty easy when you follow these few steps:

#### **1. Go to the**[**UMEE staking page**](https://wallet.keplr.app/#/umee/stake)

Which you can easily access by clicking [this link](https://wallet.keplr.app/#/umee/stake)

#### **2. Choose AUDIT.one as your validator**

You can either do this by scrolling down in the list until you find our logo or you can use the shortcut _"Ctrl + F / Command + F"_ on your keyboard and type in **AUDIT.one**

Once you've found it, click **manage** on the right side:

If you don't know what an unbonding period is, we suggest you to first learn about it in our [glossary](unbonding\_period.md).

Once you understand what it means and you've decided how many tokens you wish to stake, hit the **Delegate** button on the right.

You will be asked to approve the transaction with your wallet and choose the [transaction fee](transaction\_fees.md) (low, average or high).\
The higher the fee you are willing to pay, the faster the transaction will be completed.
