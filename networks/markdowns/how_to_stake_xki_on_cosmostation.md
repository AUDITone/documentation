Staking XKI on Cosmostation is pretty easy when you follow these few steps:

#### 1. **Select your Ki wallet in the Cosmostation mobile app**

Open the Cosmostation mobile app on your device and make sure to switch to your **Ki wallet** from the available network list.\
You'll get to see an overview of the your current XKI balance that is in your Ki wallet.

#### 2. **Choose AUDIT.one as your validator**

When you've found your Ki wallet in the app, click on the **Delegate** button to see the list of all active validators. Select the middle button "**Top**" to get the full list of active validators.\


To find us, scroll down the list until you find our logo.\


When you click on a validator, you will find some extra info. It shows the total assets bonded aka [voting power](voting\_power.md) of the validator, the estimated [APY](apy.md) and the [validator commission fee](validator\_fee.md).

Once you understand these terms, tap **Delegate** to continue.\


#### 3. **Choose the amount you wish to delegate**

Fill in the amount you wish to stake and hit **Next**

> TIP: It might be a good idea to keep a small amount of tokens in your balance to use for future transactions like claiming rewards for example.

You can add a memo to your delegation, but this is not obligatory. Continue by clicking **Next**\


You will be asked to choose the [transaction fee](transaction\_fees.md) (tiny, low or average). The higher the fee you are willing to pay, the faster the transaction will be completed.

> TIP: Click on ‘**Check Estimate Gas Amount**’ to minimize your fee.

You will now see the overview of your transaction. If everything is correct, hit **Confirm**

Before you finish the transaction, it's very important to understand the concept of an **unbonding period**. If you don't know what an unbonding period is, we suggest you to first read the guide on [what is an unbonding period?](unbonding\_period.md)\


If you understand the concept of an unbonding period, hit **Continue**.\


Wait for your transaction to be excecuted until the overview screen is shown.\
Click **Done** to go back to your wallet.

#### **Congratulations!**

You have now succesfully staked your XKI tokens!

#### 4. **Claim rewards and restake regularly to benefit from** [**compounding effects**](compounding\_interest.md)

Make sure to come back to your wallet overview to see the status of your delegation and to claim your rewards:\


You can claim your pending rewards by clicking on the **Delegate** button in your Ki wallet.\


Select the validator you have delegated your funds to under the "**My**" tab.\


Now **Claim your rewards** and they will be added to your available XKI balance which you can find in your wallet overview.\
