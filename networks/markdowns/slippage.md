# Slippage

**Slippage** is the expected % difference between the price at which you want to trade, and the price at which the trade is actually excecuted.
When trading or buying digital assets, you will often see the *"Slippage Tolerance"*. You can set the maximum % of price movement you can live with. Anything above that and your order will fail to execute.
