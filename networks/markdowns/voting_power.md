# What is voting power?

The mean purpose of blockchain technology is to make everything decentralized which means no one is in charge of it. No organization, person, or institution. 
But because decisions still need to be made sometimes, **voting power** is a way to give people or validators who hold tokens a voice in issues should they arise.
