# What is Slashing?

Validators in Proof of Stake networks who make mistakes or engage in malicious behavior can be subject to fines. These fines come in the form of taking away some or all tokens that have been staked. This term is called **Slashing**.\
Slashing occurs when a validator commits a serious offense and is one of the mechanisms that disincentivizes attempts by validators to break the rules of the protocol.

That is why it is important to choose [the right validator](importance\_of\_choosing\_the\_right\_validator.md).
