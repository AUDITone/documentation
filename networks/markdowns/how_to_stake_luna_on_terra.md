## How to stake LUNA tokens on Terra Station

#### Prerequisites:

Before continuing with this guide please be sure that:

* **You have a** [**Terra wallet**](how\_to\_create\_a\_terra\_wallet.md) OR **any other wallet that holds LUNA tokens**.
* **You have LUNA tokens in your wallet**
* **You know what** [**staking**](what\_is\_staking.md) **is.**
* **You understand** [**the risks**](risks\_of\_staking.md) **involved with staking**

***

#### **1. Go to the** [**Terra station staking page**](https://station.terra.money/stake) **and connect your wallet**

You can easily access the page by clicking this link: [Stake LUNA](https://station.terra.money/stake)

#### **2. Choose AUDIT.one as your validator**

You can either do this by scrolling down in the list until you find our logo or you can use the shortcut _"Ctrl + F / Command + F"_ on your keyboard and type in **AUDIT.one**

Once you've found it, click on our name to continue:

The screen underneath will pop up and give you some more info about AUDIT.one.\
You'll get to see our [Voting power](voting\_power.md), the amount of LUNA tokens we stake ourself, our commission or [validator fee](validator\_fee.md) and our [Uptime](uptime.md).

To proceed, hit **Delegate** on the left.

#### **3. Choose the amount you wish to delegate**

Once you've clicked on delegate, you will see this screen where you will need to fill in the amount you wish to stake.\
_(By clicking the number next to '**Available**' on the right, the maximum available amount will be filled in automatically)_\

Once you've decided how many tokens you wish to stake, hit the **Next** button.\


You will be asked to confirm the transaction with your password.\
The [transaction fee](transaction\_fees.md) is shown and and you'll get a notice that it might be a good idea, to keep a small amount of LUNA in your wallet to be able to pay future transaction fees if you want to claim pending rewards or if you want to redelegate them.\


Fill in your password and hit **Delegate** to finalise the transaction.

#### **Congratulations!**

You have now succesfully staked your LUNA tokens!

#### **4. Claim rewards and restake regularly to benefit from** [**compounding effects**](compounding\_interest.md)

Make sure to come back to the [Terra station staking page](https://station.terra.money/stake) to see the status of your delegations.\


After a while you will be able to claim pending rewards by clicking on the **Withdraw all rewards** button on the right side. These rewards will be added to your total LUNA balance and will be visible under **Available for delegation**.\
In other words, you will then be able to stake these rewards once more or transfer to another wallet.
