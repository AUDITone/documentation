Staking STAR on Stargaze is pretty easy when you follow these few steps:

Which you can easily access by clicking [this link](https://stake.stargaze.zone/stake)

#### **2. Choose AUDIT.one as your validator**

You can either do this by scrolling down in the list until you find our logo or you can use the shortcut _"Ctrl + F / Command + F"_ on your keyboard and type in **AUDIT.one**

Next to the validator's name and logo, you will also find the [voting power](voting\_power.md) and the [commission fee](validator\_fee.md).\
To proceed, hit **Delegate** on the right.

You will be asked to approve the transaction with your wallet and choose the [transaction fee](transaction\_fees.md) (low, average or high).\
The higher the fee you are willing to pay, the faster the transaction will be completed.
