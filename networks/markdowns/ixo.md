The [**IXO Protocol**](https://www.ixo.world/) defines the new standard for making Verifiable Impact Claims about how people and organisations are changing the state of the world, using high-definition data as evidence.

Claims are independently verified by trusted Prediction Oracle services, who issue Impact Proofs and certified digital credentials. These digital assets replace or enhance legacy instruments, such as Renewable Energy Certificates.

Impact Producers use their verified data, proofs and certified credentials, to mint non-fungible Impact Tokens.
