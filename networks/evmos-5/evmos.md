[**Osmosis**](https://app.osmosis.zone/) is an advanced automated market-making (AMM) protocol built using the Cosmos SDK that allows developers to design, build, and deploy their own customized AMMs. One of its key strengths is its customizable curves, fees, and other parameters, offering deep customizability to AMM designers, and a governance mechanism by which liquidity providers can govern and direct their pools. The Osmosis protocol is designed for **Cross-chain Assets**. With IBC built-in from day one, it permits connecting to the entire ecosystem of Cosmos chains and their native assets. Osmosis will also integrate with non-IBC enabled chains, including Ethereum-based blockchains, a variety of chains including Bitcoin, and alternative smart-contract platforms. The Osmosis validator nodes secure and maintain the Osmosis Network with the staking power given by its delegators.
