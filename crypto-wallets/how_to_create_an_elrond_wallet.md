# Elrond wallet

In order to be able to stake with Elrond, you will need to create an **Elrond Wallet first**.\
Go to [the Elrond wallet website](https://wallet.elrond.com/) and click on **Create Wallet**.

You will be asked to check the boxes underneath, stating that you understand the importance of safely store your Mnemonic seed phrase and that you will be transferring real eGLD tokens.\


Once you agree and checked the boxes, hit **Continue**.

A unique and personal Mnemonic seed phrase will be generated and you will be asked to store is safely.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Attention!**

_It’s very important to save this **Mnemonic Seed phrase** somewhere safe, because this will be the key to get access to your wallet._\
_Not only the words, but also the order of the words is important. Anyone who has access to this phrase, may take all of the assets you hold in that wallet. So **don’t share this with anyone.**_
{% endhint %}

Confirm that you've done that and click on **Create Wallet**.\


As a safety measure, you will be asked to fill in 3 words from your seed phrase to check if you wrote it down correctly.\
Once you've filled in the correct words, click on **Continue**.

Store this file somewhere save on your computer, as you will need this file to access your Elrond wallet.
