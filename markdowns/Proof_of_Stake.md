# Proof-of-Stake

Many cryptos use the [Proof-of-Work](Proof_of_Work.md) model to add blocks to their blockchains. The problem with Proof-of-Work is that it requires considerable computing power. That has led to significant energy usage from cryptocurrencies that use Proof-of-Work.

Proof-of-Stake, on the other hand, doesn't require nearly as much energy. This also makes it a more scalable option that can handle greater numbers of transactions.

### What is Proof-of-Stake?
Proof-of-Stake in crypto is a consensus mechanism or a way for a blockchain to validate transactions. The nodes in a blockchain must be in agreement with the present state of the blockchain and which transactions are valid.

There are different consensus mechanisms that cryptocurrencies use. Proof of stake is one of the most popular for its efficiency and because participants can earn rewards on the crypto they stake.

Staking rewards are an incentive that blockchains provide to participants. Each blockchain has a set amount of crypto rewards for validating a block of transactions. When you stake crypto and you're chosen to validate transactions, you receive those crypto rewards.
