# What is a cryptocurrency?

A cryptocurrency is a digital form of money. At its core, cryptocurrency is typically decentralized digital money designed to be used over the internet. 

Crypto makes it possible to transfer value online without the need for a middleman like a bank or payment processor, allowing value to be transferred globally, near-instantly, 24/7, for negligible fees.

Itâ€™s secure because all transactions are vetted by a technology called a [blockchain](Blockchain.md).
