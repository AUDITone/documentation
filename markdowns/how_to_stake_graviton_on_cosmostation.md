Staking GRAVITON on Cosmostation is pretty easy when you follow these few steps:

#### 1. **Select your G-Bridge wallet in the Cosmostation mobile app**

Open the Cosmostation mobile app on your device and make sure to switch to your **G-Bridge wallet** from the available network list.\
You'll get to see an overview of the your current Graviton balance that is in your G-Bridge wallet.

#### 2. **Choose AUDIT.one as your validator**

When you've found your Graviton wallet in the app, click on the **Delegate** button to see the list of all active validators. Select the middle button "**Top**" to get the full list of active validators.\


To find us, scroll down the list until you find our logo.\


When you click on a validator, you will find some extra info. It shows the total assets bonded aka [voting power](voting\_power.md) of the validator, the estimated [APY](apy.md) and the [validator commission fee](validator\_fee.md).

Once you understand these terms, tap **Delegate** to continue.\


#### 3. **Choose the amount you wish to delegate**

Fill in the amount you wish to stake and hit **Next**

> TIP: It might be a good idea to keep a small amount of tokens in your balance to use for future transactions like claiming rewards for example.

You can add a memo to your delegation, but this is not obligatory. Continue by clicking **Next**\


You will be asked to choose the [transaction fee](transaction\_fees.md) (tiny, low or average). The higher the fee you are willing to pay, the faster the transaction will be completed.

> TIP: Click on ‘**Check Estimate Gas Amount**’ to minimize your fee.

You will now see the overview of your transaction. If everything is correct, hit **Confirm**

Before you finish the transaction, it's very important to understand the concept of an **unbonding period**. If you don't know what an unbonding period is, we suggest you to first read the guide on [what is an unbonding period?](unbonding\_period.md)\


If you understand the concept of an unbonding period, hit **Continue**.\


Wait for your transaction to be excecuted until the overview screen is shown.\
Click **Done** to go back to your wallet.

#### **Congratulations!**

You have now succesfully staked your GRAVITON tokens!

#### 4. **Claim rewards and restake regularly to benefit from** [**compounding effects**](compounding\_interest.md)

Make sure to come back to your wallet overview to see the status of your delegation and to claim your rewards.\


You can claim your pending rewards by clicking on the **Delegate** button in your Graviton wallet.\


Select the validator you have delegated your funds to under the "**My**" tab.\


Now **Claim your rewards** and they will be added to your available GRAVITON balance which you can find in your wallet overview.\
