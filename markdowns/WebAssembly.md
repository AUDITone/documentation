# WebAssembly

**WASM** or WebAssembly is a type of binary-code that can be run in modern web browsers, it enables us to write code in multiple languages and run it at near-native speed on the web.

The main goal of WebAssembly is to enable high-performance applications on web pages. It is an open standard and aims to support any language on any operating system, and in practice all of the most popular languages already have at least some level of support.
