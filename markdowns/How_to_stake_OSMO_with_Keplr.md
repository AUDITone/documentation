### Prerequisites:

Before continuing with this guide please be sure that:

- **You have a [Keplr wallet](How_to_create_a_Keplr_wallet.md)**
- **You have OSMO tokens in your Keplr wallet**
- **You know what [staking](What_is_staking.md) is.**
- **You understand [the risks](Risks_of_staking.md) involved with staking**

***

### **1.  Go to the [Osmosis staking page](https://wallet.keplr.app/#/osmosis/stake)**

Which you can easily access by clicking this link: [Stake Osmosis](https://wallet.keplr.app/#/osmosis/stake)

### **2.  Choose AUDIT.one as your validator**

You can either do this by scrolling down in the list until you find our logo or you can use the shortcut _"Ctrl + F / Command + F"_ on your keyboard and type in **AUDIT.one**

Once you've found it, click **manage** on the right side:

This screen will pop up and give you some more info about the validator.

Want to get more info about this commission fee? Go to [what is a validator fee?](Validator_fee.md)<br>
To proceed, hit **Delegate** on the right bottom.


### **3.  Choose the amount you wish to delegete**

Once you've clicked on delegate, you will see this screen:

If you don't know what an unbonding period is, we suggest you to first read the guide on [what is an unbonding period?](Unbonding_period.md)

Once you understand what it means and you've decided how many tokens you wish to stake, hit the **Delegate** button on the right.

You will be asked to approve the transaction with your wallet and choose the transaction fee (low, average or high). <br>
The higher the fee you are willing to pay, the faster the transaction will be completed. [Why are there transaction fees?](Transaction_fees.md)
