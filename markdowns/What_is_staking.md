# Staking

Wether you're new to crypto or you've already taken your first steps, staking is a term you'll often come across. <br> 
Staking is a way of verifying transactions in Proof-of-Stake networks and allows participants aka "stakers" or "delegators" to earn rewards on their assets.

### But what is crypto staking? 

Staking means locking cryptocurrencies to secure the underlying blockchain network and receive rewards for that. <br>
When you stake a cryptocurrency, you commit your tokens to support a blockchain network and confirm transactions. <br>
It's only available for cryptocurrencies that use the [Proof-of-Stake](Proof_of_Stake.md) model to process payments. This is a more energy-efficient alternative to the original [Proof-of-Work](Link) model that is used by Bitcoin for example. Proof-of-work requires mining devices that use computing power to solve mathematical equations.

Staking can be a great way to generate passive income, especially because some cryptocurrencies offer high interest rates for staking. But before you get started, it's important to fully understand how crypto staking works.

### How staking works
With cryptocurrencies that use the Proof-of-Stake model, staking is how new transactions are added to the blockchain.

Staking participants first pledge their coins to the cryptocurrency protocol after which the protocol chooses validators from those participants, to confirm blocks of transactions. The more coins you pledge, the more likely you are to be chosen as a validator.

Every time a block is added to the blockchain, new cryptocurrency coins are minted and distributed as staking rewards to that block's validator. In most cases, the rewards are paid in the native cryptocurrency tokens that participants are staking. However, some blockchains use a different type of cryptocurrency for rewards.

If you want to stake crypto yourself, you don't necessarily have to become a validator. You just have to look for a validator you trust and delegate your assets to them. They will validate the transactions for you and the staking rewards, will be distributed towards the delegators.

Important to know is that your coins are still in your possession when you stake them. What you're essentialy doing is put your assets to work, and you're free to unstake them later if you want to trade them. The unstaking process may not be immediate, as for most cryptocurrencies, you're required to stake coins for a minimum amount of time.
