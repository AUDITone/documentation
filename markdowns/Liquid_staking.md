# Liquid Stacking

**Liquid staking** refers to the tokenization of staked assets to allow them to be used for other purposes.
When you stake your digital assets with a validator, these tokens can not be transferred or used directly because of the [unbonding period](unbonding_period.md) that comes with [staking](What_is_staking.md). <br>

As a remedy to this dilemma, liquid staking was created . It allows stakers to use their locked assets as collateral in other financial applications. In that way you don't miss out on possible investment opportunities or gains by trading.
