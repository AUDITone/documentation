# How to connect a blockchain wallet

You can begin using pSTAKE by signing into any of the following wallets:

* MetaMask
* WalletConnect
* WalletLink

As you sign into your Ethereum account, ensure that the MetaMask extension is installed and added to your browser.

     Recommended browser: Chrome

Refer the steps to get connected to your wallets:
MetaMask for laptop users
WalletConnect for mobile users
WalletLink for mobile users

Please follow the steps mentioned to setup wallets, 

## Steps to setup MetaMask
* [Install MetaMask Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en)
* Connect to pSTAKE and add tokens {{ cosmos.UnstakedToken }}, {{ cosmos.StakedToken }}
    * On the first Sign-in attempt, MetaMask will automatically request you to add the {{ cosmos.UnstakedToken }} and {{ cosmos.StakedToken }} tokens.
    * In case you miss the request, you can add the tokens again later using the **Add Token** button under the Assets tab, and enter the contract addresses for {{ cosmos.UnstakedToken }} and {{ cosmos.StakedToken }} tokens given in our [Contract List](pSTAKE_Smart_Contracts.md)
