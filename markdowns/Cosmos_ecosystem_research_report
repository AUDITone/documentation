Cosmos Ecosystem Research

The Cosmos Ecosystem is constantly expanding, with more projects entering the exciting world of IBC. This is good news for all Cosmonauts and the future of the crypto industry, as we continue to improve, develop, and create more utility for the entire ecosystem. 

However, this also means that it can become quite overwhelming for those who are new to the space. 

In order to acquire more in-depth knowledge and a better overall understanding, weâ€™ve developed a report that will further explore key staking statistics for the Cosmos ecosystem. With this information, users will have an easier time finding the right project/chain to support and stake their assets with.
