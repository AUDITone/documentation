# Cosmos Ecosystem Research

The Cosmos Ecosystem is constantly expanding, with more projects entering the exciting world of IBC. This is good news for all Cosmonauts and the future of the crypto industry, as we continue to improve, develop, and create more utility for the entire ecosystem. 

However, this also means that it can become quite overwhelming for those who are new to the space. 

In order to acquire more in-depth knowledge and a better overall understanding, we’ve developed a report that will further explore key staking statistics for the Cosmos ecosystem. With this information, users will have an easier time finding the right project/chain to support and stake their assets with.

With 40 active chains within Cosmos, there are plenty to choose from and each has their own respective features and utility. We’ve selected 10 chains based on the highest staked marketcap (Marketcap / Staked Value) to base our research on (as seen below).

The below graph highlights the total staked value (in millions of dollars) of PoS assets on each respective network:

Cosmos Hub is the clear frontrunner based on its staked value, with over $1.56B worth of $ATOM staked on-chain. Kava is next in line with $185M in staked value, followed by Secret Network, Osmosis, Band Protocol, and Persistence

Although the previous data points paint an important picture, the value of staked assets isn’t the most important metric to determine a chain’s security. In order to better understand how secure a chain is, the staking ratio is the most valuable metrics (# staked tokens in comparison to the total circulating supply).

When looking at a chain’s staking ratio, the rankings completely change. Based on the above chart, Persistence is now the leader, boasting a staking ratio of 85%+ of its $XPRT token. It’s then followed by Comdex, Band Protocol, Akash Network, Secret Network, and Cosmos. The higher a network’s staking ratio, the more secure it becomes.

The active number of stakers indicates how many native token holders have staked their assets on the respective networks and includes both new and current stakers.

These numbers also give a good indication of how large the average delegation is per staker, calculated by dividing the total staked value by the number of active stakers. It’s important to note that a large portion of the total staked value can be staked by the network itself (via self-delegation).

To see how truly decentralized a network is, we can take a look at some important metrics.

The first is to view how many validators are active on the chain.

Persistence recently had a proposal passed to raise the number of active validators from 75 to 100, helping make it more decentralized, as delegations will be spread over a larger set of validators.

But how decentralized a network really is can be determined by how many validators have a combined voting power of 67%. The more equal the delegation is spread across the validator set, the more decentralized the network becomes.

In the above chart, we can see that e-Money has the highest score with a voting power of more than 67% being distributed across 42 different validators - this indicates that e-Money is a very decentralized chain. Others that are highly decentralized (based on this criteria) are Juno, Comdex, and Osmosis. Cosmos, Akash Network, and Secret Network follow but are already at a distribution of half the number of validators as e-Money.

We can check the activity on each network by looking at the number of transactions executed within a certain period of time. Below, we took the data from over the last 30 days:

Two metrics that are often misunderstood are the inflation rate and staking rewards (APR). It’s important to understand that the inflation rate is different from the staking rewards, although they’re correlated. Inflation is the amount of new tokens that are minted on-chain each year. By staking, you’re able to receive a piece of those newly minted tokens.

The more users that stake, the smaller their rewards will be (given the same amount of inflation). However, with higher inflation, the total amount of rewards distributed will be larger, and therefore the portion received will be higher.

The inflation rate will also change much slower than the staking rewards rate does.

- If the staking ratio is higher than 67%, the inflation ratio will slowly decrease
- If the staking ratio is lower than 67%, the inflation ratio will slowly increase

Now how are they correlated? Staking rewards = inflation rate / staking ratio

In summary, the staking ratio influences the staking rewards users receive for staking their tokens.

The chains with currently the highest inflation rate are:

Kava sits at number 1 with an inflation rate of 100%. This means that the same amount of tokens will be minted as there are currently and that the tokens in circulation will be doubled. Osmosis is in the second position with under 50% - then comes Juno with 40%, Comdex, and Persistence with around 30%, and Secret network with an inflation rate of 15%.

When looking at the highest staking rewards, we get a different ranking distribution:

Juno currently offers the highest staking rewards with more than 68%, followed by Comdex with 38.6%, Persistence with almost 34%, and Osmosis, Kava and e-Money following.
