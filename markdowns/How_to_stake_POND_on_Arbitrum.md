# How to stake POND tokens on Arbitrum

### Prerequisites:

Before continuing with this guide please be sure that:

- **You have a [MetaMask wallet](https://myterablock.medium.com/how-to-create-or-import-a-metamask-wallet-a551fc2f5a6b#:~:text=Click%20on%20the%20MetaMask%20extension,or%20create%20a%20new%20one.&text=Click%20on%20%E2%80%9CCreate%20a%20Wallet,%E2%80%9CNo%20Thanks%E2%80%9D%20to%20proceed.)**
- **You have added the Arbitrum network to MetaMask**
- **You have POND tokens in your MetaMask wallet on the [Arbitrum network](https://blog.marlin.org/migrating-the-marlin-network-from-ethereum-to-arbitrum)**
- **You know what [staking](What_is_staking.md) is.**
- **You understand [the risks](Risks_of_staking.md) involved with staking**

***

### **1.  Go to the <a name="step1"> [Marlin staking page](https://arb1.marlin.org/relay/operator) </a>**

Which you can easily access by clicking this link: [Stake POND](https://arb1.marlin.org/relay/operator)

### **2.  Choose AUDIT.one as your validator**

You can either do this by scrolling down in the list until you find our name or you can type in **AUDIT** in the search bar.

Once you've found it, click the **delegate** icon on the right side:

### **3.  Choose the amount you wish to delegate**

This screen will pop up and ask you to **create a stash**. <br>

Here you will need to fill in the amount of POND you wish to stake. <br>
  > We suggest to keep a small amount of tokens in your balance to use for future transactions like claiming rewards for example)

When you've decided how many tokens you wish to stake, you'll first have to **approve** your POND tokens. <br>
You'll be redirected to your MetaMask wallet to sign the approval and get to see the estimated approval fee. <br>
The higher the fee you are willing to pay, the faster the transaction will be completed. [Why are there transaction fees?](Transaction_fees.md)

Once that is done, you will be able to click on the **Confirm** button on the bottom.

Keep in mind that for the actual staking of your POND, you will also have to pay a small delegation fee! <br>
Once you agree with this fee, sign the transaction and wait for it to be executed.


### **Congratulations!** 
You have now succesfully staked your POND tokens!


### **4. Claim rewards and restake regularly to benefit from [compounding effects](Compounding_interest.md)**

Make sure to come back to your [Marlin stash dashboard](https://arb1.marlin.org/relay/stash) to see the status of your delegations. <br>

You can claim your pending rewards by clicking on the **Claim** button on the right.<br>
In this case rewards will be added to your total POND balance and will be available for trading or restaking. <br>

To restake your rewards in order to generate [compound interests](Compounding_interest.md), you can now go back to [**Step 1**](#step1). <br>
