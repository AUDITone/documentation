# What is a blockchain?

A [cryptocurrency](cryptocurrency.md) blockchain is similar to a bank’s balance sheet or ledger. Each currency, has its own blockchain, which is an ongoing, constantly re-verified record of every single transaction ever made using that currency. 

Unlike a bank’s ledger, a crypto blockchain is distributed across participants of the digital currency’s entire network. No company, country, or third party is in control of it, and anyone can participate. When making a crypto payment, you don’t need to provide any sensitive information. That means there is almost zero risk of your financial information being compromised, or your identity being stolen.
