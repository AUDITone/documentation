Staking MED on Cosmostation is pretty easy when you follow these few steps:

### 1.  **<a name="step1"> Select your Medibloc wallet in the Cosmostation mobile app </a>**

Open the Cosmostation mobile app on your device and make sure to switch to your **Medibloc wallet** from the available network list. <br>
You'll get to see an overview of the your current MED balance that is in your Medibloc wallet.

### 2.  **Choose AUDIT.one as your validator**

When you've found your Medibloc wallet in the app, click on the **Delegate** button to see the list of all active validators. Select the middle button "**Top**" to get the full list of active validators. <br>

To find us, scroll down the list until you find our logo. <br>

When you click on a validator, you will find some extra info. It shows the total assets bonded aka [voting power](Voting_power.md) of the validator, the estimated [APY](APY.md) and the [validator commission fee](Validator_fee.md).

Once you understand these terms, tap **Delegate** to continue. <br>

### 3.  **Choose the amount you wish to delegate**

Fill in the amount you wish to stake and hit **Next**
  > TIP: It might be a good idea to keep a small amount of tokens in your balance to use for future transactions like claiming rewards for example.

You can add a memo to your delegation, but this is not obligatory. Continue by clicking **Next** <br>

You will be asked to choose the [transaction fee](Transaction_fees.md) (tiny, low or average). 
The higher the fee you are willing to pay, the faster the transaction will be completed. 
  > TIP: Click on ‘**Check Estimate Gas Amount**’ to minimize your fee.

You will now see the overview of your transaction. If everything is correct, hit **Confirm**

Before you finish the transaction, it's very important to understand the concept of an **unbonding period**.
If you don't know what an unbonding period is, we suggest you to first read the guide on [what is an unbonding period?](Unbonding_period.md) <br>

If you understand the concept of an unbonding period, hit **Continue**. <br>

Wait for your transaction to be excecuted until the overview screen is shown. <br>
Click **Done** to go back to your wallet.

### **Congratulations!** 
You have now succesfully staked your MED tokens!


### 4.  **Claim rewards and restake regularly to benefit from compounding effects**

Make sure to come back to your wallet overview to see the status of your delegation and to claim your rewards:<br>

You can claim your pending rewards by clicking on the **Delegate** button in your Medibloc wallet.<br>

Select the validator you have delegated your funds to under the "**My**" tab. <br>

Now **Claim your rewards** and they will be added to your available MED balance which you can find in your wallet overview.<br>

You can now go back to [**Step 1**](#step1) and restake your rewards to benefit from [compounding effects](Compound_interest.md).
