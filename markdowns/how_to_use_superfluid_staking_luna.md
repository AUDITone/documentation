#### Prerequisites:

Before continuing with this guide please be sure that:

* **You have a** [**Keplr wallet**](../crypto-wallets/how\_to\_create\_a\_keplr\_wallet.md)
* **You have** [**provided liquidity**](how\_to\_provide\_liquidity\_on\_osmosis.md) **to the LUNA/OSMO pool on** [**Osmosis**](https://app.osmosis.zone/pools)
* **You know what** [**staking**](../getting-started/what\_is\_staking.md) **is**

Superfluid staking on Osmosis is pretty easy when you follow these few steps:

#### **1. Go to the Active pools page on** [**Osmosis.zone**](https://app.osmosis.zone/pools)

Which you can easily access by clicking [this link](https://app.osmosis.zone/pools)

![Select Pool LUNA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95366163/158546130-b98bc49a-c006-4d57-8185-6719344311e7.png)

Select the LUNA/OSMO Pool #561 to proceed.

#### **2. Enable superfluid staking to earn extra rewards on your assets**

If you have provided liquidity to the LUNA/OSMO pool with a unboning period of 14 days, you will see a new button "**Go Superfluid**"

> Note that superfluid staking is only available for liquidity that was provided with a 14 day unbonding period. If you provided liquidity with 1 or 7 days unbonding, you will need to unbond and get into the 14 day unbonding period to enable superfluid staking.

Click on the button to continue and see the list of available validators.

#### **3. Choose AUDIT.one as your validator**

This screen will pop up and show you the bonded liquidity you have provided (with 14 days unbonding) and the estimated amount of OSMO that is available for superliquid staking on the bottom.

To proceed, you will first have to choose your validator to which you want to delegate your liquid assets.

You can either do this by scrolling down in the list until you find our logo or type in **AUDIT.one** in the search bar on the upper right side.

Once you've found it, select it and click on the **Bond & Stake** button.\
