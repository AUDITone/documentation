# Why would I stake

Staking is an easy way to earn interest on your cryptocurrency holdings. You don't need any equipment for crypto staking like you would for crypto mining. You're helping to maintain the security and efficiency of the blockchain. It's more environmentally friendly than crypto mining. The primary benefit of staking is that you earn more crypto, and interest rates can be very generous. In some cases, you can earn more than 10% or 20% per year. It's potentially a very profitable way to invest your money. And, the only thing you need is crypto that uses the proof-of-stake model.

Staking is also a way of supporting the blockchain of a cryptocurrency you're invested in. These cryptocurrencies rely on holders staking to verify transactions and keep everything running smoothly.
