# What is Sharding?

Sharding is a method to increase scalability in which a blockchain’s state is partitioned into individual pieces called **shards**, each of which contains a fragment of the network’s total state and transaction history. This allows nodes to process transactions for a smaller amount of data instead of the entire network, which increases the transaction throughput.
