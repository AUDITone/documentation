# Non-custodial

The therm **non-custodial** is mostly used when talking about wallets. <br>
With a non-custodial wallet, you have sole control of your private keys, which control your tokens and prove the funds are yours. While there is no need to trust a third party when using a non-custodial wallet, this also means that you are solely responsible for not losing your keys and requires that you take your own precautions to protect your assets.
