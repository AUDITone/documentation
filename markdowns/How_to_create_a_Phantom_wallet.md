# How to create a Phantom wallet

In order to be able to stake SOL on Phantom, you will need to create a **Phantom Wallet** first. <br>
Go to [the Phantom wallet app](https://phantom.app/) and install the browser extension to get started.

The Phantom app extention for desktop only works for Chrome. <br>
So if your not working in Chrome, be sure to first go ahead and download the [Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/) <br>

Click on “**Add to Chrome**”, allow the extension to be added and a Phantom symbol will appear in the right upper corner next to your search bar: <br>

Click on the Phantom extension icon you’ve just added and **create a new wallet**. _(If you already have a Phantom wallet but did not yet add the extension for your current device, you can import an existing account using your recovery phrase.)_ <br>

You will get to see a random list of words what is called the **Mnemonic Seed Phrase** and be asked to create a password for your wallet.

### **Attention!**
    
  > It’s very important to save this **Mnemonic Seed phrase** somewhere safe, because this will be the key to get access to your wallet. <br>
  > Not only the words, but also the order of the words is important. Anyone who has access to this phrase, may take all of the assets you hold in that wallet. So **don’t share this with anyone.** <br>

Choose a safe password, confirm it and **click Continue**.

The last steps of the process are a handy shortcut that is given to access your newly created Phantom wallet even faster. <br>
Hit **finish** and you are good to go! <br>
