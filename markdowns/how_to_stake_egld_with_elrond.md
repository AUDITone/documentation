## How to stake eGLD on Elrond

#### Prerequisites:

Before continuing with this guide please be sure that:

* **You have an** [**Elrond wallet**](../crypto-wallets/how\_to\_create\_an\_elrond\_wallet.md)
* **You have at least one eGLD token in your Elrond wallet**
* **You know what** [**staking**](../getting-started/what\_is\_staking.md) **is.**
* **You understand** [**the risks**](../getting-started/risks\_of\_staking.md) **involved with staking**

***

**IMPORTANT NOTE**

Staking eGLD requires a minumum delegation of **1 eGLD**.\
If you don't have this amount in your wallet, you will not be able to stake.\


#### **1. Go to the** [**Elrond staking dashboard**](https://wallet.elrond.com/delegation)

Which you can easily access by clicking this link: [Stake eGLD](https://wallet.elrond.com/delegation)\
On the dashboard, you will see an overview of your delegations. Hit one of the two **Stake Now** buttons on the right to get started.

#### **2. Choose AUDIT.one as your validator and fill in the amount you wish to stake**

You can either do this by scrolling down in the list until you find our logo or you can use the shortcut _"Ctrl + F / Command + F"_ on your keyboard and type in **AUDIT.one**

Once you've found it, select AUDIT.one and hit **Continue**:

On the following screen you will see some more info about AUDIT.one:

* A [link](https://audit.one) to our website
* [The validator commission fee](../glossary/validator\_fee.md)
* The Annual Percentage Rate (APR).

Here you will be asked how many eGLD tokens you would like to stake.\


**As mentioned before, this method requires a minimum stake of 1 eGLD**\


You can either fill in the amount manualy or use the slide bar underneath the entry bar to select your amount.\
_(If you want to stake all available tokens on your account, just hit the '**MAX**' button on the right of the entry bar and it will fill in automatically.)_
