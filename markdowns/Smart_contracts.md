# What Is a Smart Contract?

A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. <br>
The code and the agreements contained therein exist across a distributed, decentralized blockchain network. <br>
The code controls the execution, and transactions are **trackable and irreversible**.

Smart contracts permit trusted transactions and agreements to be carried out among disparate, 
anonymous parties without the need for a central authority, legal system, or external enforcement mechanism.
