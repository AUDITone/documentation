# What is a smart contract?

A **smart contract** is a piece of self-executing software on the [blockchain](blockchain.md) with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.
The code and the agreements contained therein exist across a distributed, decentralized blockchain network. 
The code controls the execution and transactions are **trackable and irreversible**.

Smart contracts permit trusted transactions and agreements to be carried out among disparate, anonymous parties without the need for a central authority, legal system, or external enforcement mechanism.
