# How to stake LUNA tokens on Terra

### Prerequisites:

Before continuing with this guide please be sure that:

- **You have a [Terra wallet](How_to_create_a_Terra_wallet.md)** OR **any other wallet that holds LUNA tokens**.
- **You have LUNA tokens in your wallet**
- **You know what [staking](What_is_staking.md) is.**
- **You understand [the risks](Risks_of_staking.md) involved with staking**

***

### **1.  Go to the [Terra station staking page](https://station.terra.money/staking) and connect your wallet**

You can easily access the page by clicking this link: [Stake LUNA](https://station.terra.money/staking)

### **2.  Choose AUDIT.one as your validator**

You can either do this by scrolling down in the list until you find our logo or you can use the shortcut _"Ctrl + F / Command + F"_ on your keyboard and type in **AUDIT.one**

Once you've found it, click on our name to continue:

The screen underneath will pop up and give you some more info about AUDIT.one. <br>
You'll get to see our [Voting power](Voting_power.md), the amount of LUNA tokens we stake ourself, our commission or [validator fee](Validator_fee.md) and our [Uptime](Uptime.md).

To proceed, hit **Delegate** on the left.


### **3.  Choose the amount you wish to delegate**

Once you've clicked on delegate, you will see this screen where you will need to fill in the amount you wish to stake. <br>
_(By clicking the number next to '**Available**' on the right, the maximum available amount will be filled in automatically)_ <br>

Once you've decided how many tokens you wish to stake, hit the **Next** button. <br>

You will be asked to confirm the transaction with your password. <br>
The [transaction fee](Transaction_fees.md) is shown and and you'll get a notice that it might be a good idea, to keep a small amount of LUNA in your wallet to be able to pay future transaction fees if you want to claim pending rewards or if you want to redelegate them. <br>

Fill in your password and hit **Delegate** to finalise the transaction.

### **Congratulations!** 
You have now succesfully staked your LUNA tokens!

### **4.   Claim rewards and restake regularly to benefit from [compounding effects](Compounding_interest.md)**

Make sure to come back to the [Terra station staking page](https://station.terra.money/staking) to see the status of your delegations. <br>

After a while you will be able to claim pending rewards by clicking on the **Withdraw all rewards** button on the right side.<br>
These rewards will be added to your total LUNA balance and will be visible under **Available for delegation**. <br>
In other words, you will than be able to stake these rewards once more or transfer to another wallet.
