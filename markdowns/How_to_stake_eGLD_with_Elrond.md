# How to stake eGLD on Elrond

### Prerequisites:

Before continuing with this guide please be sure that:

- **You have an [Elrond wallet](How_to_create_an_Elrond_wallet.md)**
- **You have at least one eGLD token in your Elrond wallet**
- **You know what [staking](What_is_staking.md) is.**
- **You understand [the risks](Risks_of_staking.md) involved with staking**

***

#### IMPORTANT NOTE
Staking eGLD requires a minumum delegation of **1 eGLD**. <br>
If you don't have this amount in your wallet, you will not be able to stake. <br>

### **1.  Go to the [Elrond staking dashboard](https://wallet.elrond.com/delegation)**

Which you can easily access by clicking this link: [Stake eGLD](https://wallet.elrond.com/delegation) <br>
On the dashboard, you will see an overview of your delegations. Hit one of the two **Stake Now** buttons on the right to get started.

### **2.  Choose AUDIT.one as your validator and fill in the amount you wish to stake**

You can either do this by scrolling down in the list until you find our logo or you can use the shortcut _"Ctrl + F / Command + F"_ on your keyboard and type in **AUDIT.one**

Once you've found it, select AUDIT.one and hit **Continue**:

On the following screen you will see some more info about AUDIT.one:
  * A [link](https://audit.one) to our website
  * [The validator commission fee](Validator_fee.md)
  * The Annual Percentage Rate (APR).

Here you will be asked how many eGLD tokens you would like to stake. <br>

**As mentioned before, this method requires a minimum stake of 1 eGLD** <br>

You can either fill in the amount manualy or use the slide bar underneath the entry bar to select your amount. <br>
_(If you want to stake all available tokens on your account, just hit the '**MAX**' button on the right of the entry bar and it will fill in automatically.)_

Once you've decided how many tokens you wish to stake, hit the **Continue** button and confirm your request in the next screen.

### **Congratulations!** 
You have now succesfully staked your eGLD tokens!


### **3.  Claim rewards and restake regularly to benefit from [compounding effects](Compounding_interest.md)**

Make sure to come back to the [Elrond staking dashboard](https://wallet.elrond.com/delegation) to see the status of your delegations. <br>

Scroll down to see the status of your delegations. <br>
