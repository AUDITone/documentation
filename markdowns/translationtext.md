 ## Suggest a translation

If you would like to translate a certain page, you can do that by clicking on the pencil icon in the upper right corner of the page.

By clicking it you will be redirected to the GitHub sign-in page, where you can either log in if you already have an account, or create a new one in case you don't.

Once logged in, you'll be taken to the markdown file, where you can suggest changes to the page. 
The fastest way to translate a page is to click the "**Cancel changes**" button in the right upper corner.

This will now give you the option to copy the raw contents.

Once you've copied the original file, you can now [create a new file](#adding-a-page), paste the raw text in it, and translate the doc sentence by sentence.
In that way it is easier for you to use the same lay-out as the original file.
