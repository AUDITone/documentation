# What is market cap?

Market capitalization (market cap) measures the total market value of a cryptocurrency. It is calculated by multiplying the token supply with its current price. 
Because different projects have different amounts of tokens (supply) and different prices, the market cap is used to measure a projectâ€™s overall value in comparable terms.
