# How to stake AKT tokens on Keplr 

### Prerequisites:

Before continuing with this guide please be sure that:

- **You have a [Keplr wallet](How_to_create_a_Keplr_wallet.md)**
- **You have AKT tokens in your Keplr wallet**
- **You know what [staking](What_is_staking.md) is.**
- **You understand [the risks](Risks_of_staking.md) involved with staking**

***


Staking AKT with Keplr is pretty easy when you follow these few steps:

<a name="step1" >
### **1.  Go to the [Akash staking page](https://wallet.keplr.app/#/akashnet/stake)**
</a>

Which you can easily access by clicking [this link](https://wallet.keplr.app/#/akashnet/stake)

![Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95366163/147964603-17f93b7b-4389-4a4f-8638-368ee679e4fe.png)


### **2.  Choose AUDIT.one as your validator**

You can either do this by scrolling down in the list until you find our logo or you can use the shortcut _"Ctrl + F / Command + F"_ on your keyboard and type in **AUDIT.one**

Once you've found it, click **manage** on the right side:

![Select AUDIT](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95366163/147964617-c330502e-85f8-4b1b-b428-f8599387cab9.png)

This screen will pop up and give you some more info about the validator.

![Click Delegate First](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95366163/148521007-e1639b17-c41f-45d4-bc63-d8c23c435db6.png)

Click [here](Validator_fee.md) to get more info about this commission fee. <br>

To proceed, hit **Delegate** on the right bottom.


### **3.  Choose the amount you wish to delegete**

Once you've clicked on delegate, you will see this screen:

If you don't know what an unbonding period is, we suggest you to first read the guide on [what is an unbonding period?](Unbonding_period.md)

Once you understand what it means and you've decided how many tokens you wish to stake, hit the **Delegate** button on the right.

You will be asked to approve the transaction with your wallet and choose the transaction fee (low, average or high). <br>
The higher the fee you are willing to pay, the faster the transaction will be completed. [Why are there transaction fees?](Transaction_fees.md)

If you want to check the status of your transaction, you can fill in your wallet address on [Minstscan.io](https://www.mintscan.io/akash). <br>
There you will find more details about the delegation and see all previous transactions that have been made.

### **Congratulations!** 
You have now succesfully staked your AKT tokens!


### **4.  Claim rewards and restake regularly to benefit from [compounding effects](Compounding_interest.md)**

Make sure to check your **Keplr web extention** on a regular basis to see the status of your delegation.

You can claim your pending rewards by clicking on the **Claim** button next to your **Pending staking awards**.<br>
You will be asked to approve the transaction again with your wallet and choose the transaction fee. <br>
Once the transaction is complete, these rewards will be added to your available AKT balance. <br> <br>

![Claim Rewards](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95366163/148522002-7b77bba7-9371-4b91-ac02-a9be775cdb7c.png)

You can now go back to [**Step 1**](#step1) and restake your rewards to benefit from the [compounding effect](Compounding_interest.md).
