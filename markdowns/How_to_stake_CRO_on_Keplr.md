# How to stake CRO tokens on Keplr

### Prerequisites:

Before continuing with this guide please be sure that:

- **You have a [Keplr wallet](How_to_create_a_Keplr_wallet.md)**
- **You have CRO tokens in your Keplr wallet**
- **You know what [staking](What_is_staking.md) is**
- **You understand [the risks](Risks_of_staking.md) involved with staking**

***


Staking CRO on Keplr is pretty easy when you follow these few steps:

### **1.  Go to the <a name="step1"> [Crypto.com staking page](https://wallet.keplr.app/#/crypto-org/stake) </a>**

Which you can easily access by clicking [this link](https://wallet.keplr.app/#/crypto-org/stake)

### **2.  Choose AUDIT.one as your validator**

You can either do this by scrolling down in the list until you find our logo or you can use the shortcut _"Ctrl + F / Command + F"_ on your keyboard and type in **AUDIT.one**

Once you've found it, click **manage** on the right side:

This screen will pop up and give you some more info about the validator.

Click [here](Validator_fee.md) to get more info about this commission fee. <br>
To proceed, hit **Delegate** on the right bottom.


### **3.  Choose the amount you wish to delegate**

Once you've clicked on delegate, you will see this screen:

If you don't know what an unbonding period is, we suggest you to first learn about it in our [glossary](Unbonding_period.md).

Once you understand what it means and you've decided how many tokens you wish to stake, hit the **Delegate** button on the right.

You will be asked to approve the transaction with your wallet and choose the [transaction fee](Transaction_fees.md) (low, average or high). <br>
The higher the fee you are willing to pay, the faster the transaction will be completed.

If you want to check the status of your transaction, you can fill in your wallet address on [Minstscan.io](https://www.mintscan.io/crypto-org). <br>
There you will find more details about the delegation and see all previous transactions that have been made.

### **Congratulations!** 
You have now succesfully staked your CRO tokens!


### **4.  Claim rewards and restake regularly to benefit from [compounding effects](Compounding_interest.md)**

Make sure to check your **Keplr web extention** on a regular basis to see the status of your delegation.

You can claim your pending rewards by clicking on the **Claim** button next to your **Pending staking awards**.<br>
You will be asked to approve the transaction again with your wallet and choose the transaction fee. <br>
Once the transaction is complete, these rewards will be added to your available CRO balance. <br> <br>
