[**Stargaze**](https://stargaze.zone/) is one of the first NFT markets to launch in the Cosmos ecosystem. [Cosmos](../networks/cosmos/) is a network of custom interoperable blockchains. It is currently the second largest ecosystem by volume, and includes [Terra](terra.md), Cosmos Hub, Thorchain, and [Osmosis](broken-reference).

Stargaze aims to be a decentralized NFT market, totally owned and governed by its users.\
