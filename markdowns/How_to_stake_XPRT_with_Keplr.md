# How to stake XPRT tokens on Keplr 

### Prerequisites:

Before continuing with this guide please be sure that:

- **You have a [Keplr wallet](How_to_create_a_Keplr_wallet.md)**
- **You have [XPRT tokens](How_to_get_XPRT_tokens.md) in your Keplr wallet**
- **You know what [staking](What_is_staking.md) is.**
- **You understand [the risks](Risks_of_staking.md) involved with staking**

***


Staking XPRT with Keplr is pretty easy when you follow these few steps:

### **1.  Go to the [Persistence staking page](https://wallet.keplr.app/#/core/stake)**

Which you can easily access by clicking this link: [Stake XPRT](https://wallet.keplr.app/#/core/stake)

### **2.  Choose AUDIT.one as your validator**

You can either do this by scrolling down in the list until you find our logo or you can use the shortcut _"Ctrl + F / Command + F"_ on your keyboard and type in **AUDIT.one**

Once you've found it, click **manage** on the right side:

![Select AUDIT](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95366163/146570268-17dae741-9e8c-4ebf-879d-0e7e1bac55f5.png)

This screen will pop up and give you some more info about AUDIT.one.

Want to get more info about this commission fee? Go to [what is a validator fee?](Validator_fee.md)<br>
To proceed, hit **Delegate** on the right bottom.


### **3.  Choose the amount you wish to delegete**

Once you've clicked on delegate, you will see this screen:

If you don't know what an unbonding period is, we suggest you to first read the guide on [what is an unbonding period?](Unbonding_period.md)

Once you understand what it means and you've decided how many tokens you wish to stake, hit the **Delegate** button on the right.

You will be asked to approve the transaction with your wallet and choose the transaction fee (low, average or high). 
The higher the fee you are willing to pay, the faster the transaction will be completed. [Why are there transaction fees?](Transaction_fees.md)


### **Congratulations!** 
You have now succesfully staked your XPRT tokens!


### **4.  Sit back and watch your tokens earn rewards**

Make sure to come back to the [Keplr dashboard](https://wallet.keplr.app/#/dashboard) to see the status of your delegation:

You can claim your pending rewards by clicking on the **Claim Reward** button in the upper right corner.<br>
These rewards will be added to your available OSMO balance which you can find on the left under your wallet information.<br>

Or you can go directly to the **Keplr web extention** in your browser to see your progress and claim your pending rewards:
