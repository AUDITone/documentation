Risks of staking crypto

There are a few risks of staking crypto to understand:

Crypto prices are volatile and can drop quickly. If your staked assets suffer a large price drop, that could outweigh any interest you earn on them.
Staking can require that you lock up your coins for a minimum amount of time. During that period, you're unable to do anything with your staked assets such as selling them.
When you want to unstake your crypto, there may be an unstaking period of seven days or longer.
The biggest risk you face with crypto staking is that the price goes down. Keep this in mind if you find cryptocurrencies offering extremely high staking reward rates.

For example, many smaller crypto projects offer high rates to entice investors, but their prices then end up crashing. If you're interested in adding crypto to your portfolio but you'd prefer less risk, you may want to opt for cryptocurrency stocks instead.

Although crypto that you stake is still yours, you need to unstake it before you can trade it again. It's important to find out if there's a minimum lockup period and how long the unstaking process takes so you don't get any unwelcome surprises.

When you should or shouldn't stake crypto
If you have crypto that you can stake and you aren't planning to trade it in the near future, then you should stake it. It doesn't require any work on your part, and you'll be earning more crypto.

What if you don't have any crypto you can stake yet? There are many that offer staking, but you should first evaluate whether each cryptocurrency is a good investment. It only makes sense to buy a crypto for staking if you also believe it's a good long-term investment.

Here are a few of the major cryptocurrencies you can stake:

Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) was the first cryptocurrency with a programmable blockchain that developers can use to create apps. Ethereum started out using proof of work, but it's transitioning to a proof-of-stake model.
Cardano (CRYPTO:ADA) is an eco-friendly cryptocurrency. It was founded on peer-reviewed research and developed through evidence-based methods.
Polkadot (CRYPTO:DOT) is a protocol that allows different blockchains to connect and work with one another.
Solana (CRYPTO:SOL) is a blockchain designed for scalability since it offers fast transactions with low fees.
Considering the returns you can make, it's worth researching these and other cryptos with staking.

You may be wondering why only some cryptocurrencies have staking. As previously noted, proof of stake isn't the first or the only consensus mechanism.

Proof of work was the first consensus mechanism since it originated with Bitcoin. Other early cryptocurrencies followed in its footsteps until Peercoin (CRYPTO:PPC) introduced proof of stake in 2012.

There is also debate over which consensus mechanism is the more secure option. Although the computational power required by proof of work uses substantial energy, it also makes proof-of-work blockchains difficult to attack. Some cryptocurrencies choose proof of work for this reason.

The proof-of-stake model has been beneficial for both cryptocurrencies and crypto investors. Cryptocurrencies can use proof of stake to process large numbers of transactions at minimal costs. Crypto investors also get the opportunity to collect passive income from their holdings. Now that you know more about staking, you can start investigating cryptos that offer it.
