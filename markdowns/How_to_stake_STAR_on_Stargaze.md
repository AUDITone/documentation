# How to stake STAR tokens on Stargaze 

### Prerequisites:

Before continuing with this guide please be sure that:

- **You have a [Keplr wallet](How_to_create_a_Keplr_wallet.md)**
- **You have STAR tokens in your Keplr wallet**
- **You know what [staking](What_is_staking.md) is**
- **You understand [the risks](Risks_of_staking.md) involved with staking**

Staking STAR on Stargaze is pretty easy when you follow these few steps:

### **1.  Go to the <a name="step1"> [Stargaze staking page](https://stake.stargaze.zone/stake) </a>**

Which you can easily access by clicking [this link](https://stake.stargaze.zone/stake)

![Dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95366163/149343886-a6de1a8f-7b62-433f-8567-d8963c1b7daa.png)


### **2.  Choose AUDIT.one as your validator**

You can either do this by scrolling down in the list until you find our logo or you can use the shortcut _"Ctrl + F / Command + F"_ on your keyboard and type in **AUDIT.one**

Next to the validator's name and logo, you will also find the [voting power](Voting_power.md) and the [commission fee](Validator_fee.md). <br>
To proceed, hit **Delegate** on the right.

### **3.  Choose the amount you wish to delegate**

Once you've clicked on delegate, you will see this screen:

You will be asked to approve the transaction with your wallet and choose the [transaction fee](Transaction_fees.md) (low, average or high). <br>
The higher the fee you are willing to pay, the faster the transaction will be completed.

If you want to check the status of your transaction, you click on the transaction hash on the right. <br>
There you will find more details about the delegation and see all previous transactions that have been made with your wallet.

### **Congratulations!** 
You have now succesfully staked your STAR tokens!


### **4.  Claim rewards and restake regularly to benefit from [compounding effects](Compounding_interest.md)**

Make sure to check your **Stargaze dashboard** on a regular basis to see the status of your delegation.

You can claim your pending rewards by clicking on the **Claim** button under your rewards.<br>

![Claim](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95366163/149344432-afe18976-9384-4138-9d84-8f01c9f5466e.png)

Select the validator of which you want to claim your rewards and hit the **claim** button to continue. <br>

![Select rewards](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95366163/149344622-ede67ae6-80e7-4546-95b3-d415f62f6f69.png)

You will be asked to approve the transaction again with your wallet and choose the transaction fee. <br>
Once the transaction is complete, these rewards will be added to your available STAR balance. <br> <br>

Here again you can check the status of your transaction by clicking on the transaction hash on the right. <br>

You can now go back to [**Step 1**](#step1) and restake your rewards to benefit from [compounding effects](Compounding_interest.md).
