## How to stake CMDX tokens on Omniflix

#### Prerequisites:

Before continuing with this guide please be sure that:

* **You have a** [**Keplr wallet**](../crypto-wallets/how\_to\_create\_a\_keplr\_wallet.md)
* **You have CMDX tokens in your Keplr wallet**
* **You know what** [**staking**](what\_is\_staking.md) **is**

Staking CMDX on Keplr is pretty easy when you follow these few steps:

#### **1. Go to the**[**Comdex staking page**](https://comdex.omniflix.co/stake)

Which you can easily access by clicking [this link](https://comdex.omniflix.co/stake)

![Dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95366163/149314141-bb3dc7a3-6800-4fc8-90dd-a82752d7fa0f.png)

#### **2. Choose AUDIT.one as your validator**

You can either do this by scrolling down in the list until you find our logo or you can use the shortcut _"Ctrl + F / Command + F"_ on your keyboard and type in **AUDIT.one**

Next to the validator's name and logo, you will also find the [voting power](voting\_power.md) and the [commission fee](validator\_fee.md).\
To proceed, hit **Delegate** on the right.

#### **3. Choose the amount you wish to delegate**

Once you've clicked on delegate, you will see this screen:

You will be asked to approve the transaction with your wallet and choose the [transaction fee](transaction\_fees.md) (low, average or high).\
The higher the fee you are willing to pay, the faster the transaction will be completed.

If you want to check the status of your transaction, you click on the transaction hash on the right.\
There you will find more details about the delegation and see all previous transactions that have been made with your wallet.

#### **Congratulations!**

You have now succesfully staked your CMDX tokens!

#### **4. Claim rewards and restake regularly to benefit from** [**compounding effects**](compounding\_interest.md)
