# How to stake KAVA tokens on Keplr

### Prerequisites:

Before continuing with this guide please be sure that:

- **You have a [Keplr wallet](How_to_create_a_Keplr_wallet.md)**
- **You have KAVA tokens in your Keplr wallet**
- **You know what [staking](What_is_staking.md) is**
- **You understand [the risks](Risks_of_staking.md) involved with staking**

***


Staking KAVA on Keplr is pretty easy when you follow these few steps:

### **1.  Go to the <a name="step1"> [KAVA staking page](https://wallet.keplr.app/#/kava/stake) </a>**

Which you can easily access by clicking [this link](https://wallet.keplr.app/#/kava/stake)

### **2.  Choose AUDIT.one as your validator**

You can either do this by scrolling down in the list until you find our logo or you can use the shortcut _"Ctrl + F / Command + F"_ on your keyboard and type in **AUDIT.one**

Once you've found it, click **manage** on the right side:

This screen will pop up and give you some more info about the validator.

Click [here](Validator_fee.md) to get more info about this commission fee. <br>
To proceed, hit **Delegate** on the right bottom.


### **3.  Choose the amount you wish to delegate**

Once you've clicked on delegate, you will see this screen:

If you don't know what an unbonding period is, we suggest you to first learn about it in our [glossary](Unbonding_period.md).

Once you understand what it means and you've decided how many tokens you wish to stake, hit the **Delegate** button on the right.

You will be asked to approve the transaction with your wallet and choose the [transaction fee](Transaction_fees.md) (low, average or high). <br>
The higher the fee you are willing to pay, the faster the transaction will be completed.

### **Congratulations!** 
You have now succesfully staked your KAVA tokens!

Make sure to check your **Keplr web extention** on a regular basis to see the status of your delegation.

You can claim your pending rewards by clicking on the **Claim** button next to your **Pending staking awards**.<br>
You will be asked to approve the transaction again with your wallet and choose the transaction fee. <br>
Once the transaction is complete, these rewards will be added to your available KAVA balance. <br> <br>
