# What is cloud computing?

The term Cloud computing refers to the provision of IT infrastructure or hardware, database, cloud storage, data security, and accessibility of different software resources over the Internet.

The Cloud is basically a group of servers that provide businesses with computing resources by giving them remote access to storage, technology, application services. It gives your business flexibility to pay only for the services you use, and you do not need to purchase or maintain any physical IT Infrastructure, data center, or servers.
