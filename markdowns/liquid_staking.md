# Liquid Stacking

**Liquid staking** refers to the tokenization of staked assets to allow them to be used for other purposes. When you stake your digital assets with a validator, these tokens can not be transferred or used directly because of the [unbonding period](../../markdowns/unbonding\_period.md) that comes with [staking](what\_is\_staking.md).\


As a remedy to this dilemma, liquid staking was created . It allows stakers to use their locked assets as collateral in other financial applications. In that way you don't miss out on possible investment opportunities or gains by trading.
