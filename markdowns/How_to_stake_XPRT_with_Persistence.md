# How to stake XPRT tokens on Persistence

### Prerequisites:

Before continuing with this guide please be sure that:

- **You have a [Persistence wallet](How_to_create_a_Persistence_wallet.md)**
- **You have [XPRT tokens](How_to_get_XPRT_tokens.md) in your Persistence wallet**
- **You know what [staking](What_is_staking.md) is.**
- **You understand [the risks](Risks_of_staking.md) involved with staking**

***

### **1.  Go to the [Persistence staking page](https://wallet.persistence.one/dashboard/staking)**

Which you can easily access by clicking this link: [Stake XPRT](https://wallet.persistence.one/dashboard/staking)

### **2.  Choose AUDIT.one as your validator**

You can either do this by scrolling down in the list until you find our logo or you can use the shortcut _"Ctrl + F / Command + F"_ on your keyboard and type in **AUDIT.one**

Once you've found it, click **Actions** on the right side:

![Select Audit one](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95366163/146393399-cdf4a306-bc03-4e9a-9dfd-5fe9a6beadb5.png)


This screen will pop up and give you some more info about AUDIT.one.

Want to get more info about this commission fee? Go to [what is a validator fee?](Validator_fee.md)<br>
To proceed, hit **Delegate** on the left.


### **3.  Choose the amount you wish to delegate**

Once you've clicked on delegate, you will see this screen:

You will be asked to put in the amount of XPRT you wish to stake before you can continue. <br>
_(By clicking the word '**Balance**' underneath the entry bar, the maximum available amount will be filled in automatically)_

Once you've decided how many tokens you wish to stake, hit the **Next** button.

You will be asked to choose the transaction fee (low, average or high). 
The higher the fee you are willing to pay, the faster the transaction will be completed. [Why are there transaction fees?](Transaction_fees.md)

### **Congratulations!** 
You have now succesfully staked your XPRT tokens!


### **4.  Claim rewards and restake regularly to benefit from [compounding effects](Compounding_interest.md)**

Make sure to come back to the [Persistence dashboard](https://wallet.persistence.one/dashboard/wallet) to see the status of your delegations. <br>

You can claim your pending rewards by clicking on the green **Claim** button on the right side.<br>
These rewards will be added to your total XPRT balance and will be visible as **Delegatable** or **Transferable**. <br>
In other words, you will than be able to stake these rewards once more or transfer to another wallet.
