# How to activate Superfluid staking on Osmosis

### Prerequisites:

Before continuing with this guide please be sure that:

- **You have a [Keplr wallet](How_to_create_a_Keplr_wallet.md)**
- **You have provided liquidity to the ATOM/OSMO pool on [Osmosis](https://app.osmosis.zone/pools)**
- **You know what [staking](What_is_staking.md) is**
- **You understand [the risks](Risks_of_staking.md) involved with staking**

***

Superfluid staking on Osmosis is pretty easy when you follow these few steps:

### **1.  Go to the Active pools page on [Osmosis.zone](https://app.osmosis.zone/pools)**

Which you can easily access by clicking [this link](https://app.osmosis.zone/pools)

![Select Pool](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95366163/156808885-d95a4a07-246b-43c4-8848-abaa672bec7a.png)

Select the ATOM/OSMO Pool #1 to proceed.

  > Note that as of 1st March 2022, superfluid staking has only been enabled for this pool. More pools will be added in the future

### **2.  Enable superfluid staking to earn extra rewards on your assets**

If you have provided liquidity to the ATOM/OSMO pool with a unboning period of 14 days, you will see a new button "**Go Superfluid**"

  > Note that superfluid staking is only available for liquidity that was provided with a 14 day unbonding period. If you provided liquidity with 1 or 7 days unbonding, you will need to unbond and get into the 14 day unbonding period to enable superfluid staking.

Click on the button to continue and see the list of available validators.

### **3.  Choose AUDIT.one as your validator**

This screen will pop up and show you the bonded liquidity you have provided (with 14 days unbonding) and the estimated amount of OSMO that is available for superliquid staking on the bottom.

To proceed, you will first have to choose your validator to which you want to delegate your liquid assets.

You can either do this by scrolling down in the list until you find our logo or type in **AUDIT.one** in the search bar on the upper right side.

![Choose AUDIT](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95366163/157020221-6e724a18-def5-4d9a-9ff2-fcb9c4698a01.png)

Once you've found it, select it and click on the **Bond & Stake** button.
<br>

### **Congratulations!** 
You have now activated Superfluid staking on Osmosis and will start to earn extra rewards on your assets.

You can now see the overview of your Superfluid stake and the estimated [APR](APR.md) that you are earning on the provided liquidity.
