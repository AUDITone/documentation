[**Elrond**](https://elrond.com/) is a blockchain-based platform that allows users to create and develop decentralized applications and [cryptocurrencies](Cryptocurrency.md) to create a new internet economy. The project aims to resolve the burning problem of traffic congestion on [blockchain](Blockchain.md) networks by offering solutions for scalability. Elrond offers fast transactions and a scalable environment for developers, enterprises, and users, alongside a user-friendly experience and low transaction fees.

The network can reportedly achieve up to 15,000 transactions per second, which makes it one of the fastest blockchain networks on the market. The native token is known as EGLD, and is a multi-purpose cryptocurrency. EGLD is used for staking, voting, and transacting on the network. It is the central asset in the incentivization system that rewards network participants. Elrond also has a latency of six seconds, can scale with [sharding](Sharding.md), and offers attractive [transaction fees](Transaction_fees.md) of $0.001.
