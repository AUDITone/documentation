Want to get more info about this commission fee? Go to[what is a validator fee?](validator\_fee.md)\
To proceed, hit the **Stake** button.

#### 3. **Choose the amount you wish to delegate**

Before you continue to stake, it's very important to understand the concept of an **unbonding period**. If you don't know what an unbonding period is, we suggest you to first read the guide on [what is an unbonding period?](unbonding\_period.md)\


Once you understand what it means and you've decided how many tokens you wish to stake, fill in the amount and choose the transaction fee (low, average or high). The higher the fee you are willing to pay, the faster the transaction will be completed.\
[Why are there transaction fees?](transaction\_fees.md)\


Hit **stake**, wait for the transaction to be completed and finish of by hitting the **Confirm** button when it's done.\

#### **Congratulations!**

You have now succesfully staked your OSMO tokens!

#### 4. **Claim rewards and restake regularly to benefit from** [**compounding effects**](compounding\_interest.md)

Make sure to go back to the overview to see the status of your delegation and to claim your rewards:\
