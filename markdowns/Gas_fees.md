# Gas fees

**Gas fees** are payments made by users to compensate for the computing energy required to process and validate transactions on the **Ethereum blockchain**. "Gas limit" refers to the maximum amount of gas (or energy) that you're willing to spend on a particular transaction. A higher gas limit means that you must do more work to execute a transaction using ETH or a [smart contract](smart_contracts.md).
