You will be asked to put in the amount of MNTL you wish to stake before you can continue.\
_(By clicking the word '**Balance**' underneath the entry bar, the maximum available amount will be filled in automatically)_

> TIP: It might be a good idea to keep a small amount of tokens in your balance to use for future transactions like claiming rewards for example.

Once you've decided how many tokens you wish to stake, hit the **Submit** button.

You will be asked to choose the transaction fee (low, average or high). The higher the fee you are willing to pay, the faster the transaction will be completed. [Why are there transaction fees?](transaction\_fees.md)
