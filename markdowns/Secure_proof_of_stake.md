# Secure Proof of Stake

Similar to traditional [Proof of Stake](Proof_of_Stake.md), Secure Proof of Stake is used to secure the network, validate transactions, and distribute newly minted tokens.
SPoS eliminates [Proof of Work](Proof_of_work.md) computational waste by combining **eligibility through stake** (a validator is more likely to create a block depending on the amount of currency they hold and how long they have kept it compared to other validators), **rating with random validator selection**, and an **optimal dimension for the consensus group**. 
The SPoS consensus protocol maintains a high-security level by randomly sampling the consensus group and randomly shuffling nodes into other shards to prevent collusion. It uses an unbiasable, unpredictable randomness source generated by the block proposer via signing the previous random source.
