# Terra

[**Terra**](https://www.terra.money/) offers multiple stablecoin options that provide instant settlement. They rely on a price-stability algorithm that actively alters the monetary supply of an asset to retain value. In this way, Terra can provide users with lower fees, more stability, seamless cross-border exchanges, and highly responsive financial assets.

Terra's ultimate goal is to disrupt traditional banking via the mass adoption of stablecoin [cryptocurrencies](cryptocurrency.md) and [DeFi](defi.md) infrastructure.
