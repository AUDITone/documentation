# What is DeFi?

**DeFi** is short for “**decentralized finance**” and represents equivalents to financial instruments such as trading, borrowing or lending, with the distinction that they are running exclusively on the blockchain through one or multiple interconnected [smart contracts](../../markdowns/smart\_contracts.md).

DeFi products are seen as potential replacements for traditional finance, thanks to their abilities of offering the same features, but operating 24/7, at lower cost and without requiring human intervention.
