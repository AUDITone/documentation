# What is a DAO?

A **DAO** (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is an organization governed by its members in a decentralized manner.\
By utilizing [smart contracts](../../markdowns/smart\_contracts.md), members are able to transparently vote on proposals, which can then be executed autonomously.
