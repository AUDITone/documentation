# Contributing to our Wiki page

This wiki was created to provide easy access to staking for everyone. We wanted to provide the most essential information and easy step-by-step staking guides in order to make staking more accessible to the masses. 

It is an open source project so that anyone who wants to can contribute to the wiki.
We strongly encourage pull requests, discussions, improvements and other contributions from our community. 

# How to Contribute

You can contribute to the wiki on the [Github repository page](https://github.com/auditOne/documentation). Every page is a [MarkDown file](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), which is an easy to learn syntax extension to plain text that makes creating links, rendering images, and nice-looking formatting simple.

Each doc has a pencil icon in the upper right corner of the page. By clicking it you are taken to the GitHub sign-in page, where you can either log in or create an account.

Once logged in, you'll be taken to the GitHub built-in text editor where you can make your edits directly. When you've completed your changes, you can add any specific details on what was changed and **commit to a new branch** to create a new Pull Request to the repository. From there, one of the admins will review your changes, and either merge them or request changes.
